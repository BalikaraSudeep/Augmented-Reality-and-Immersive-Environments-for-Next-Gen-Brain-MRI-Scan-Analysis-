Augmented-Reality-and-Immersive-Environments-for-Next-Gen-Brain-MRI-Scan-Analysis
Abstract : Patients diagnosed with brain tumors often struggle to understand their condition, the tumor's location, size, and impact, and the proposed treatment plan. Traditional 2D MRI scans can be confusing, and verbal explanations may not be enough. Enhancing Patient Understanding of Brain Tumors Using Augmented Reality mechanism -based 3D Visualization of MRI Scans using immersive environment (which is a artificial environment that uses to create a realistic and interactive experiences for a patients and doctor. Further enhancing their perception of reality by adding virtual elements to the physical environment for the sake of user-friendly system like mobile apps and augmented reality set by artificial intelligence with Vertex AI. The results are carried out Augmented Reality mechanism -based 3D Visualization of MRI Scans using immersive environment.

Keywords: Immersive Environment, MRI Brain Images, Augmented reality, Brain Tumor.
